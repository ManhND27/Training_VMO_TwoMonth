{"id": "CVE-2019-1543", "description": "ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b).

Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.
